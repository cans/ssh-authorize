cans.ssh-authorize
==================

A simple role to setup SSH authorization on user account in bulk

Given a directory (`public_keys` by default) that contains a set of
files each containing a public key, merges those files to produce the
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the remote user account.

The actual file created depends on the value of several variables:

    "{{sshauthz_homes_dir}}/{{sshauthz_user}}/{{sshauthz_ssh_config_dirname}}/{{sshauthz_authorized_keys_filename}}"

Which allows for fairly particualar setup if needed. But of course
default value for those variable should be applicable for most setups.

Note: As this role operates in a quite blunt fashion, for efficiency
reasons, to avoid locking you out of the machine, this role offers
a mecanism to check you key exists in the source directory
